TODO: 


+ make lines deletable
+ allow changing volume (use +/- keys)
- change volume with scroll-wheel
+ hook things up to beats
- allow changing beats (not important)
- maybe, instead of changing volume the ability to 
  use a key to quickly duplicate a line
  (with some x offset, or some random position around the original, 
   also the line could be randomized to be a bit funkier) 
+ key to delete everything 
- something quite interresting happens when you hold down the window 
  scaling button - should be possible to do the same thing when pressing 
  space bar
- ability to save/load
+ ability to clear out everything
- show proper octaves and notes (c d e f g... ) super-light as an orientation. 
- build method into it so people can easily export audio/video? 
  nah... just use snapz! 
- make the space-bar the "live" key, where the mouse-velocity is played. 
- possibility to chose off-beats (?)
- hold down "s" like speed - 
  drag along x-axis to change playback-speed, 
  drag along y-axis to change beat-speed. 
- use l ("link"), to link the beat directly to the generated beat, 
  or to allow drawing on arbitrary offbeats
+ allow spawing from the middle of a line

  the second line copies the player from line (1) as soon as it reaches
  the intersection.
