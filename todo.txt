FEATURES: 

- change volume with scroll-wheel
- something quite interresting happens when you hold down the window 
  scaling button - should be possible to do the same thing when pressing 
  space bar
- make the space-bar the "live" key, where the mouse-velocity is played. 
- make bars bigger/smaller according to volume
- allow to change beat with 0...5 when selected/hovered
- when curve is delete remove it along with the last runner
- make runners friendlier? 
- kids spawn off with the beat-subdivision that is selected (e.g. 0=1-> every single one, 2->every second one, etc.) 
- allow lines to move while drawing the babysitter, this will make it much more understandable!!
- maybe, instead of changing volume the ability to 
  use a key to quickly duplicate a line
  (with some x offset, or some random position around the original, 
   also the line could be randomized to be a bit funkier) 
- show regions of f1-f12 keys (remember the selection, or something 
  like that)

BUGS: 

- saving/loading when fullscreen
- wave forms are not correct right now, 
  sin is chopped, 
  rect+triangle seem too high. 
- sometimes when dragging lines get distorted


DONE: 

+ make lines deletable
+ allow changing volume (use +/- keys)
+ hook things up to beats
+ key to delete everything 
+ ability to clear out everything
+ show proper octaves and notes (c d e f g... ) super-light as an orientation. 
+ possibility to chose off-beats (?)
+ allow spawing from the middle of a line
+ selecting multiple nodes, then being able to delete, change volume, moving around
+ different wave forms (flat, rectangle, triangle, sinus)
  --------------------------- (1)
            \
             \___________ (2)
  
  the second line copies the player from line (1) as soon as it reaches
  the intersection. 
+ saving and loading 
+ move instead of delete when touching on the circle
+ add motion to the lines themselves
+ bring all heads back into the screen


MAYBE LATER: (=not gonna happen)

- when hovering over a potential spawn allow pressing "alt" to draw anywhere
- drag to any edge to delete
- use l ("link"), to link the beat directly to the generated beat, 
  or to allow drawing on arbitrary offbeats
- hold down "s" like speed - 
  drag along x-axis to change playback-speed, 
  drag along y-axis to change beat-speed. 
- build method into it so people can easily export audio/video? 
  nah... just use snapz!
